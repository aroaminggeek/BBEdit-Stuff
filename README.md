# BBEdit Stuff
My scripts, CLMs etc for [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/):

* A CLM for the [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) templating language
* A bash script to preview ReStructuredText in browser.
* A stupid simple script to run flake8 on your python code, output to a `bbresults` window
* Another stupid simple script to run autopep8 on the active document, in place changes.

12-11-2017:  
Added CLM for [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython). It's a work in progress, so feel free to fork/submit PRs etc.
